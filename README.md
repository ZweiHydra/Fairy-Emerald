# Fairy Emerald Lite
## A "simple" romhack to practice the skills. It is intended to be a mostly barebones change, focused entirely on adding the fairy typing a small number of extected additions that go with it. Namely items and TMs that go with it.

It will include a hand selected number of engine changes since they're available with no additional time cost, and additional quality of life features.
